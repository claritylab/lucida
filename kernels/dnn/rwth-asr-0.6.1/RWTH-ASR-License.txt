This license is derived from the Q Public License v1.0 and the Qt
Non-Commercial License v1.0 which are both Copyright by Trolltech AS,
Norway.

The aim of this license is to lay down the conditions enabling you to
use, modify and circulate the SOFTWARE, use of third-party application
programs based on the Software and publication of results obtained
through the use of modified and unmodified versions of the SOFTWARE.

However, RWTH remain the authors of the SOFTWARE and so retain
property rights and the use of all ancillary rights.

The SOFTWARE is defined as all successive versions of RWTH ASR
software and their documentation that have been developed by RWTH.

When you access and use the SOFTWARE, you are presumed to be aware of
and to have accepted all the rights and obligations of the present
license:


1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
   provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in
   this license. Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or
   software items that link with the Software, in any form signifies
   acceptance of this license for non-commercial use only.

2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form
   provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted to
   - copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the
   initial developer of the Software, is distributed.

3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
   modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such
   as patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

    a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
       the Software.

    b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
       license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
       initial developer of the Software to distribute your
       modification in future versions of the Software provided such
       versions remain available under these terms in addition to any
       other license(s) of the initial developer.

4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
   machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software,
   provided that you meet these restrictions:

    a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

    b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable
       forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable
       source code to the distributed Software, including all
       modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data
       transfer, and place prominent notices in the distribution
       explaining this.

    c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
       machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
       license.

5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
   compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you
   or by others.

6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
   software items, in a non-commercial setting, that link with the
   original or modified versions of the Software. These items, when
   distributed, are subject to the following requirements:

    a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms
       of these items are also able to receive and use the complete
       machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
       beyond the costs of data transfer.

    b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
       and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items
       in both machine-executable and source code forms. The
       recipients must be able to do so without any charges
       whatsoever, and they must be able to re-distribute to anyone
       they choose.

    c. If an application program gives you access to functionality of
       the Software for development of application programs, reusable
       components or other software components (e.g. an application
       that is a scripting wrapper), usage of the application program
       is considered to be usage of the Software and is thus bound by
       this license.

    d. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
       initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
       then you must supply one.

7. Users must cite the authors of the Software upon publication of
   results obtained through the use of original or modified versions
   of the Software by refering to the following publication:

    D. Rybach, C. Gollan, G. Heigold, B. Hoffmeister, J. Lööf,
    R. Schlüter, and H. Ney: "The RWTH Aachen University Open Source
    Speech Recognition System". In Interspeech 2009,
    Brighton, U.K., 2009. 

8. In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be
   liable for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted
   to - lost revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special,
   incidental or consequential damages, even if they have been advised
   of the possibility of such damages, except to the extent invariable
   law, if any, provides otherwise.

9. The Software and this license document are provided "AS IS" with NO
   EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WARRANTY OF
   DESIGN, ADAPTION, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.

   You assume all risks concerning the quality or the effects of the
   SOFTWARE and its use. If the SOFTWARE is defective, you will bear
   the costs of all required services, corrections or repairs.

10. This license has the binding value of a contract.

11. The present license and its effects are subject to German law and
    the competent German Courts.
