PocketSphinx 5prealpha

This is PocketSphinx, one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source
large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition
engine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

THIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM.  This is also an early release of a
research system.  We know the APIs and function names are likely to
change, and that several tools need to be made available to make this
all complete.  With your help and contributions, this can progress in
response to the needs and patches provided.

To compile:

First, you *must* have SphinxBase, which you can download from
http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/.  You should download and unpack it to
the same parent directory as PocketSphinx, so that the configure script
and project files can find it. On Windows, you will need to rename
'sphinxbase-X.Y' (where X.Y is the SphinxBase version number) to simply
'sphinxbase' for this to work.

In a unix-like environment (such as linux, solaris etc):

 * build and optionally install SphinxBase.  If you want to use
   fixed-point arithmetic, you *must* configure SphinxBase with the
   --enable-fixed option.

 * if you downloaded directly from the CVS repository, you need to do
   this at least once to generate the "configure" file:

% ./autogen.sh

 * if you downloaded the release version, or ran "autogen.sh" at least
   once, then compile and install:

% ./configure
% make clean all
% make test
% make install

XCode Installation (for iPhone):

Sphinxbase uses the standard unix autogen system, and there's a script
included, 'build_for_iphone.sh' that will setup configure to create
binaries that are XCode friendly.

1) ./autogen.sh
2) ./build_for_iphone.sh simulator
3) ./build_for_iphone.sh device

Then in XCode, open your project info, and for 'All Configurations', and
set:

'Header Search Paths' = "$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/include/pocketsphinx"
'Library Search Paths' = "$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/lib"
'Other Linker Flags' = "-lpocketsphinx"

In MS Windows (TM), under MS Visual Studio 2010 (or newer - we test
with Visual C++ 2010 Express):

 * load sphinxbase.sln located in sphinxbase directory

 * compile all the projects in SphinxBase (from sphinxbase.sln)

 * load pocketsphinx.sln in pocketsphinx directory

 * compile all the projects in PocketSphinx

MS Visual Studio will build the executables under .\bin\Release or
.\bin\Debug (depending on the version you choose on MS Visual Studio),
and the libraries under .\lib\Release or .\lib\Build.

Test scripts are forthcoming for Windows.
