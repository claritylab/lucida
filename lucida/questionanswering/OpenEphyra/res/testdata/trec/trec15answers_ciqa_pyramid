43	2	0.428571428571429	19981210 The ``formal consent and commitment of the government of Egypt is a prerequisite for a natural gas supply agreement,'' Israel's Ministry of National Infrastructure said in a statement. ``This is required because of the linkage made in the past, by the government of Egypt, between the commercial negotiations and the political situation.''
43	3	0.428571428571429	19991222 For most of its independent life, Israel was prevented by boycotts from buying oil or gas from its Arab neighbors.
43	4	0.428571428571429	20000914 Because it had no choice, Israel has always relied on fuel from far outside the Arab world: it now ships in coal from Australia, Colombia and South Africa, and crude oil from Norway, Britain and Mexico.
43	5	0.714285714285714	19981210 An Egyptian gas pipeline is snaking its way east across the Sinai desert, laying the groundwork for a regional power network that could bind Israel closer to its Arab neighbors and radically change its energy and security strategy.
43	6	0.714285714285714	19990909 In June, a natural gas reservoir was found undersea off the Israeli city of Ashdod, north of Gaza, estimated to be able to produce 30 million cubic feet of gas per day.
43	7	0.857142857142857	20000406 Earlier in March, the company said that its "Mary 1" drilling site off Ashkelon pointed to reserves of 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, which it said could supply one third of Israel's natural gas needs.
43	8	1	20000927 The gas field is one of the two gas fields recently found in an Israeli-controlled area. Seventy percent of the area of the second gas field, which was discovered at Gaza Strip's northern border area, belongs to the Palestinian National Authority while the rest is under Israeli control.
43	9	0.857142857142857	20000914 To begin with, it was not clear if there was such a thing as Palestinian territorial waters, given the Authority's nonsovereign status. The Oslo accords assigned the Palestinians a 20-by-20-mile swath of sea for limited ``fishing, recreation, and economic activity,'' but said nothing about resources beneath the Mediterranean.
43	10	0.714285714285714	20000914 But by default, the Authority and BG reasoned, the area between Egypt's eastern maritime boundary and Israel's self-identified exploration zone was Palestinian. Though Israel could restrict shipping off Gaza for security reasons, it never claimed economic rights there.
43	11	1	20000914 Natural gas would make desalination plants an affordable adjunct to power plants serving the densely populated Gaza and Israeli seacoast, helping to resolve an acute potable water scarcity that is one of the region's most difficult diplomatic and environmental problems.
43	12	0.571428571428571	19981210 Late last month, the Infrastructure Ministry postponed until next year a self-imposed December 1998 deadline for plans on importing natural gas, expanding electrical generating capacity, and possibly converting existing plants to gas from coal.
43	13	0.571428571428571	19981210 The ministry has also proposed huge gas-fired desalination plants to satisfy demands for drinkable water in the Gaza Strip.
43	14	0.714285714285714	20000404 Industry experts say importing natural gas, a cleaner and cheaper fuel than oil or coal, from Egypt would save Israel 150 million U.S. dollars annually as compared to any viable alternative.
43	15	0.714285714285714	20000927 The BG Group of London, which won a concession in November from Arafat's Palestinian Authority to drill in the 2,000-foot-deep waters off the Gaza Strip, said Wednesday that this first Gaza test well was flowing at a strong 37 million cubic feet a day, more than in any of eight recent offshore gas strikes in nearby Israeli territorial waters.
43	16	0.857142857142857	20000914 The Israelis and Palestinians are both respecting the unofficial division of coastal exploration rights, despite angry objections from Israeli rightists and some local energy companies, who are suing in Israeli courts to stop the Gaza drilling.
43	17	0.857142857142857	20000914 Having its own gas reserves _ plus access to nearby Palestinian deposits _ should make it easier for Israel to buy additional gas from Egypt, which is now building a gas pipeline to the Israeli border, analysts say. Israel's objection to Egyptian gas was fear of dependence on a single Arab supplier.
43	18	0.714285714285714	20000404 Last December, Egyptian government finally agreed to sell natural gas to Israel, a decision coming shortly after the Israeli- Syrian peace talks were resumed.
43	19	0.714285714285714	20000406 The company said Thursday that the new finding, along with a series of initial gas discoveries off Israeli coast near Ashdod and Ashkelon in the past few months, had made the talks on purchasing gas from Egypt meaningless.
43	20	0.714285714285714	20000914 The Palestinians already plan to use the offshore gas at three new power stations they are building; the first, near Gaza City, will be ready this year, followed by plants in Nablus and Hebron.
