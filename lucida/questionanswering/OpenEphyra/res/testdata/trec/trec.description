This folder contains question sets and answer keys from past TREC evaluations.
Please take a look at the TREC website at <http://trec.nist.gov/> for more
information about the data. In the publications section of the website, you can
also find details about the evaluations, approaches followed by participants,
and their performance.

Note that some obvious errors in the answers and patterns files have been fixed.
We recommend to look at the diff between these files and the files on the TREC
website to identify the changes.

We would like to thank the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
for allowing us to redistribute this data.
