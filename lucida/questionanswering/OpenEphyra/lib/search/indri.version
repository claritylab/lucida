Indri 2.6 Java Library

A shared library is required in addition to the file 'indri.jar' in this folder.
You need to add a file named 'libindri_jni.so' for Linux, 'libindri_jni.jnilib'
for Mac OS, or 'indri_jni.dll' for Windows to the folder.

Also note that the 'jar' file and the shared library must be for the same
version of Indri. Indices built with older versions of Indri may still work, but
some versions of Indri (such as 2.6) are not downward compatible.
