Getting Started:
----------------

If you just like to run OpenEphyra in command line mode, try the following:

- Go to the folder 'scripts'.
- Execute OpenEphyra.sh (Unix, Linux, and Mac OS) or OpenEphyra.bat (Windows).
- Type in a factoid question, 'LIST:' followed by a list question, or 'exit'.

The only system requirements are a Java runtime environment (version 1.5 or
later) and about 1 GB of free RAM.
