NOTE: By default this microservice is for personal use only. For commercial usage contact Google for a commercial client secret.

This microservice allows Lucida to access user's Google Assistant. This microservice takes only speech input and returns speech as well as text output. Text input is handled by question answering Google Assistant library which can be found at questionanswering/googleassist.
