# Automatic Speech Recognition
## Building ASR

```
$ make 
```

## Starting ASR
Open a second terminal to this same location. In the first terminal, start up
the server with this command:

`$ ./server (PORT`

In the second one, run the client with a .wav file:

`$ ./client (PORT) <AUDIO FILE>`

PORT = the port that the Kaldi Server uses
