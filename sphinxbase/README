CMU Sphinx common libraries
---------------------------

This package contains the basic libraries shared by the CMU Sphinx
trainer and all the Sphinx decoders (Sphinx-II, Sphinx-III, and
PocketSphinx), as well as some common utilities for manipulating
acoustic feature and audio files.

Installation Guide: 

This section contains installation for various platforms

Linux/Unix installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

sphinxbase is used by other modules.  The convention requires the
physical layout of the code looks like this:
    package/
    sphinxbase/

So if you get the file from a distribution, you might want to rename
sphinxbase-X.X to sphinxbase by typing

    > mv sphinxbase-X.X sphinxbase (where X.X being the version of sphinxbase)

If you downloaded directly from the Subversion repository, you need to 
create the "configure" file by typing

    > ./autogen.sh

If you downloaded a release version or if you have already run
"autogen.sh", you can build simply by running

    > ./configure
    > make

If you are compiling for a platform without floating-point arithmetic,
you should instead use:

    > ./configure --enable-fixed --without-lapack
    > make

You can also check the validity of the package by typing

    > make check 

and then install it with 

    > make install

This defaults to installing SphinxBase under /usr/local. You may
customize it by running ./configure with an argument, as in

    >./configure --prefix=/my/own/installation/directory

XCode Installation (for iPhone):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sphinxbase uses the standard unix autogen system, and there's a script
included, 'build_for_iphone.sh' that will setup configure to create
binaries that are XCode friendly.

1) ./autogen.sh
2) ./build_for_iphone.sh simulator
3) ./build_for_iphone.sh device

Then in XCode, open your project info, and for 'All Configurations', and
set:

'Header Search Paths' = "$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/include/sphinxbase"
'Library Search Paths' = "$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/lib"
'Other Linker Flags' = "-lsphinxbase"

Windows Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To compile sphinxbase in Visual Studio 2010 Express (or newer):
1, unzip the file.
2, rename the directory to sphinxbase
3, go into the sphinxbase folder and click sphinxbase.sln
4, in the menu, choose Build -> Rebuild All -> Batch Build -> Build

In Step 4, make sure all projects are selected, preferably the
"Release" version of each.

If you are using cygwin, the installation procedure is very similar to
the Unix installation. However, there is no audio driver support in
cygwin currently so one can only use the batch mode recognzier.
