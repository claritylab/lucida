University of Michigan hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, irrevocable (subject to the termination provision below) license
under any rights in any patent claims owned by University of Michigan, to make,
have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the

Michigan’s rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications
to the Software made by you or a third party, or (ii) the Software in
combination with any software or other technology provided by you or a third
party.

The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
for anyone that makes any claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or
other action) alleging (a) direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or
inducement to infringe any patent: (i) by University of Michigan or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the
Software, (ii) by any party if such claim arises in whole or in part from any
software, product or service of University of Michigan or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the
Software, or (iii) by any party relating to the Software; or (b) that any right
in any patent claim of University of Michigan is invalid or unenforceable.
